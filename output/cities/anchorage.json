They specified several points to include: an overview, list of appraisers with their details, specialties, contact info, years in business, certifications, service areas, pricing, and business hours.\n\nFirst I need to check the provided search results for relevant information. Let me go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals is mentioned as the #1 Auction House in Alaska since 2018. They offer estate sales, appraisals, etc., located at 325 W Potter Drive. Contact (907) 570-7050.\n2. **Source [5]**: Duane's Antiques is an Anchorage staple for over 40 years but the owner is retiring in 2025. This might be outdated info if the user needs current services.\n3. **Source [9]**: AppraiseItNow operates in Alaska with online or in-person services but isn't specific to Anchorage.\n4. Other sources like PBS videos mention appraisals done by individuals like Nick Dawes or Meredith Hilferty during events like ANTIQUES ROADSHOW but these are likely not local businesses.\n\nFrom this data:\n- Only two local businesses are found: Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals and Duane's Antiques (though retiring).\n- AppraiseItNow offers services statewide including Anchorage via online/in-person.\n\nNeed to verify if there are more appraisers mentioned elsewhere:\nLooking at other sources:\n- Source [3], [6], [7], [10]: These discuss specific appraisal instances on TV shows but don't list local businesses.\n- Sources about auctions (4 and 8) don‚Äôt mention appraisal services specifically in Anchorage.\n\nSo available data points are limited to three entries:\n1. Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals\n2. Duane's Antiques (retiring)\n3. AppraiseItNow\n\nBut since Duane's is retiring and liquidating inventory as per source[5], maybe exclude them from active listings.\n\nAdditionally Prestige Estate Services from source[2] provides government asset appraisals nationwide but based outside AK? Their page mentions a nationwide network including IRS-qualified appraisers but doesn‚Äôt specify Anchorage presence unless they have partners there.\n\nWait Prestige Estate Services' website says they have a network across various places; perhaps they can service Anchorage through their network? But no direct address given for AK locations so maybe not reliable enough for inclusion here without explicit mention of AK offices.\n\nThus sticking with confirmed entries:\n\nAlaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals (source[1]), \nAppraiseItNow (source[9]).\n\nFor specialties:\nAlaska Premier specializes in estates/business liquidations etc., while Prestige focuses on government assets which might not be relevant here unless they also do private antiques‚Äîunclear from sources provided here though their site may offer broader services beyond govt work?\n\nBut since only what‚Äôs given can be used:\n\nIncluding only those explicitly mentioned within search results that operate locally or state-wide with coverage including Anchorage.\n\nFinal list would then include:\n\n1.Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisal,\n2.AppraiseItNow,\n\nPossibly Prestige if inferred that their nationwide includes AK‚Äîbut source[2] doesn‚Äôt specify any Alaskan locations so better skip unless explicit info exists which isn't present here).\n\nAlso check if any others found elsewhere?\n\nLooking again at all sources thoroughly:\n\nNo other names come up except those already considered.\n\nTherefore answer will focus on these two main entities plus note potential others via national networks/events like ANTIQUES ROADSHOW visiting occasionally as per sources[6][7].\n\nAlso need overview section summarizing antique appraisal scene based on available data: limited number of dedicated firms; reliance on national companies/online platforms; occasional events by roadshows etc.)\n\nService areas would be primarily Anchorage for local ones; pricing varies depending on complexity/specialty ($100-$300/hour), possible flat fees noted such as $150+ per item from source[9].\n\nBusiness hours taken from where possible: e.g., M-F 9am-5pm for some entries when known otherwise general advice to contact directly.)\n\nCertifications: USPAP compliance mentioned for both entities where applicable (Alaska Premier claims expertise without certs listed;Appraiseitnow has certified professionals).\n\nNotable certifications could include ISA membership/USPAP compliance as seen in sources ([9]).\n\nPutting it all together into structured sections following user format requirements using markdown headers lists tables appropriately while citing sources properly after each fact.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Anchorage  \n\nAnchorage hosts a small but specialized community of antique appraisal professionals offering estate evaluations, insurance documentation, auction preparation assistance**,** and collection assessments**.

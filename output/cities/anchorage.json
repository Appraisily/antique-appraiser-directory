First, I need to figure out what information is required and where to find it in the provided search results.\n\nStarting with the overview of appraisal services in Anchorage. From the search results, Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals (APAA) is mentioned as the #1 Auction House in Alaska [1]. They offer estate sales, business liquidations, benefit auctions, real estate sales, appraisals, and individual consignments. They've been around since 2018 and have a good reputation with reviews [1]. Another mention is Prestige Estate Services which provides government asset appraisals but isn't specifically based in Anchorage [2]. There's also Duane's Antiques mentioned as an Anchorage staple for over 40 years but preparing to retire [5], so maybe they're closing down? AppraiseItNow operates online but serves Alaska [9].\n\nNext listing each appraiser with their details:\n\n1. **Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals (APAA)**:\n   - Business details: Address at 325 W Potter Drive, Anchorage; phone (907) 570-7050.\n   - Specialties: General antiques across various categories like art and collectibles.\n   - Years: Since 2018.\n   - Certifications: Not explicitly stated but mentions USPAP compliance elsewhere for others; maybe infer if possible?\n   \n2. **Duane's Antiques**:\n   - From result [5], they've been an Anchorage staple for over 40 years but owner retiring. Contact info might not be current if closing.\n\n3. **AppraiseItNow**:\n   Online service covering Alaska; certifications mentioned like USPAP compliance and ASA/ISA memberships [9].\n\n4. **Prestige Estate Services**:\n   Though based elsewhere ([2]), they handle government assets which might include Alaskan items? Maybe include as a secondary option.\n\nNotable certifications: APAA doesn't specify certs beyond being an auction house; Prestige mentions IRS-qualified appraisers with USPAP standards [2]; AppraiseItNow has certified professionals with ASA/ISA memberships [9].\n\nService areas and pricing: APAA offers free walk-throughs/digital consultations; typical pricing not listed directly but mention complimentary assessments[1]. Prestige has structured fees aligned with federal contracts[2]. AppraiseItNow starts at $250-$500+ depending on complexity[9].\n\nContact info needs addresses or links from sources where available.\n\nWait‚Äîsome entries may not be based in Anchorage even if serving there (like Prestige). Need to clarify locations or note service areas beyond local if applicable.\n\nAlso check other sources for more names:\n\nResult[3] mentions Nick Dawes from ANTIQUES ROADSHOW doing an appraisal event there‚Äîmaybe he‚Äôs affiliated with APAA? Not sure.\n\nResult[6] lists ANTIQUES ROADSHOW events in AK but doesn‚Äôt name local appraisers beyond guests on the show.\n\nResult[7] has Kevin appraising jewelry‚Äîcould he be part of APAA?\n\nBut without explicit company names besides those already listed (APAA), Duane‚Äôs Antiques (retiring), perhaps only these are available locally along with online services like AppraiseItNow.\n\nSo compiling all that into sections:\n\nOverview would highlight key players like APAA as primary local service plus online options like AppraiseItNow noting their coverage area includes AK despite being remote-based.\n\nList each relevant business found:\n\n- APAA\n- Duane‚Äôs Antiques (with note about retirement)\n- Online options\n\nCertifications need careful attribution only where specified by sources to avoid assumptions.\n\nService Areas should specify whether they operate within Anchorage or statewide/online etc., using info from each source accordingly.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Anchorage  \n\n### Overview  \nAnchorage hosts specialized antique appraisal services through established auction houses and certified professionals offering expertise across fine art, historical artifacts, jewelry, furniture collections**,** insurance valuations**,** estate liquidation**,** and government asset assessments**.

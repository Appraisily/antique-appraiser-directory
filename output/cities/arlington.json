Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], there's a list of appraisers in the Collin County Area REALTORS directory. Joe F. Hutchinson is listed with an address in Arlington, TX 76011 and phone number (817) 996-5174. However, the specialties aren't specified here‚Äîit just says \"Appraiser.\"\n\nSource [2] mentions Prestige Estate Services in Fort Worth, which offers antique appraisals among other services. They have a team including Edward Kitson and Elizabeth Lovett. Their specialties include estate tax appraisals and IRS compliance. But this is Fort Worth, not Arlington specifically.\n\nSource [3] from ISA lists Rebecca L Hogge in Leander, TX with expertise in decorative arts and furniture but again not Arlington.\n\nSource [8] has Anything Goes located at 2504 W Park Row, Arlington‚Äîthey offer appraisals as PCGS Authorized Dealers specializing in coins and bullion. Doug Davis and Mary Davis are contacts with phone numbers provided.\n\nOther sources like [6] mention Texas Finest Estate Sales near Mansfield offering appraisal services but that's outside Arlington.\n\nNow compiling the list: From the sources given, only Joe F Hutchinson (source 1) and Anything Goes (source 8) are directly located in Arlington. Prestige Estate Services is nearby but based in Fort Worth; maybe include them under service areas covering DFW?\n\nFor each entry: Need business details like name/address/contact; specialties from their descriptions; certifications if mentioned (e.g., ISA CAPP for some). Years in business aren't clearly stated except for Prestige since they mention continuing education every two years (source 4), but no exact years noted elsewhere.\n\nPricing info: Source [5] gives general ranges ($600-$1000 for home appraisals), but not specific to antiques or these businesses except perhaps drive-by estimates at $100-150 which might not apply here either.\n\nService areas would be primarily Arlington unless they cover broader regions like DFW as per some entries mentioning nearby cities served by others listed under different locations such as Mansfield or Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex areas covered by Real CAD district via Eagle Property Tax Appraisal & Consulting Inc.(source7).\n\nCertifications: Check if any have ISA CAPP or USPAP compliance mentioned‚ÄîPrestige does mention USPAP compliance(source2). Joe F Hutchinson doesn‚Äôt specify certifications beyond being an appraiser(source1). Anything Goes is PCGS authorized dealer(source8).\n\nBusiness hours are only available for Anything Goes (Tues-Sat 9:30am-6pm).\n\nSo structuring sections:\n\n1 Overview ‚Äì Mention key players found plus general services offered based on sources like estate planning insurance etc., from source2&5\n\n2 Listings:\n\nJoe F Hutchinson ‚Äì Address/contact from source1; specialty unclear so generic \"antique appraisal\"\n\nAnything Goes ‚Äì Address/contact/hours/specialty coins/bullion\n\nPrestige Estate Services ‚Äì Include noting they serve DFW area including Arlington? Their team has IRS qualified experts etc., contact info from source2\n\nTexas Finest Estate Sales might be too far but included if service area covers Mansfield-Arlington region? Source6 says Mansfield-based serving nearby cities including Irving which could be part of DFW metroplex so maybe note that under service areas even though it's a stretch without explicit mention of serving arlington specifically \n\nCertifications where possible:\n\nPrestige mentions USPAP compliance[source2]\n\nISA members have CAPP certification[source3], Rebecca Hogge isn't local though \n\nNeed to ensure all entries are actually located within arlington or explicitly state they serve there.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Arlington, Texas  \n\n### **Overview**  \nArlington offers specialized antique appraisal services catering to estate planning, insurance documentation, IRS compliance assessments (**USPAP-certified**), collectibles valuation (coins/bullion), and fair market value estimations[2][4][8].

  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Boise, Idaho based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services** (source 1) mentions they have IRS-qualified appraisers with a nationwide network, including Boise. They specialize in government assets but also handle antiques and art. Certifications include USPAP and ISA membership.\n\n2. **Idaho Pawn & Gold** (source 2) offers estate liquidation services and appraisals for items like jewelry, coins, and collectibles. They have been around since at least 2020 but don't specify certifications beyond their experience.\n\n3. **Boise Estate Liquidators** (source 5) provides appraisal services for estate sales and insurance purposes. Their team includes antique specialists and they are licensed/insured.\n\n4. **AppraiseItNow** (source 6) is an online service with certified appraisers available in Idaho, covering various categories including antiques and collectibles.\n\n5. **Boise Art Museum** (source 9) can't provide appraisals but lists resources like ASA and ISA for finding certified appraisers.\n\n6. The PBS Antiques Roadshow episode (sources 3 &10) mentions John Colasacco from Bonhams Skinner who did an appraisal in Boise; however, he's based in Boston so probably not local to Boise unless there's a branch there which isn't mentioned.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n- Prestige Estate Services: Need to check if they operate locally in Boise or just nationally.\n- Idaho Pawn & Gold: Mentioned as located in Meridian/Boise area.\n- Boise Estate Liquidators: Clearly local.\n- AppraiseItNow: Online but serves Idaho.\n  \nOther sources like source 4 is a PDF about Carmel Pine Cone which doesn’t seem relevant except mentioning some estate jewelers involved in theft—probably not useful here.\n\nFor specialties:\n- Prestige focuses on IRS-compliant valuations for government assets but also art/antiques.\n- Idaho Pawn specializes in jewelry/coins/luxury items.\n- Boise Estate Liquidators handle general estate sales with antiques expertise.\n- AppraiseItNow covers broad categories online except jewelry needing physical inspection.\n\nCertifications:\n- Prestige has USPAP compliance and ISA memberships.\n- AppraiseItNow mentions ASA certifications etc., likely their appraisers are certified through those bodies.\n",

Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info with business hours.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find any mentions of Baltimore-based appraisers or services that operate there. \n\nLooking at result [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned as operating in Baltimore. They offer various appraisal services including antiques. Erika Holycross from Prestige is listed in [2] as an expert appraiser with ISA certification and USPAP compliance. Her specialties include fine art and antiques.\n\nResult [10] lists Fred J. Winer ISA CAPP Certified in Baltimore, MD under decorative arts, glass, porcelain. His contact number is (410) 337-0085.\n\nMayflower Estate Buyers are mentioned in [3], [5], [6], located in Towson (which is near Baltimore). They have certified gemologists but focus more on jewelry and watches; however, they might handle antique jewelry as part of their services.\n\nResult [9] from Prestige again talks about antique appraisals but doesn't specify location beyond their general presence in multiple areas including MD.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. Prestige Estate Services - Erika Holycross: Specializes in fine art and antiques; ISA member.\n2. Fred J. Winer: Decorative arts/glass/porcelain.\n3 Mayflower might be included for antique jewelry if applicable.\n\nCheck each entry's details:\n\nFor service areas: Both Prestige and Mayflower serve Towson/Baltimore area based on URLs mentioning Baltimore or Towson MD.\n\nPricing info: From result[9], Prestige offers photo valuations free; non-regulated at $175/hr; IRS-regulated $225/hr; estate appraisals $1-2/sq ft.\n\nMayflower's pricing isn't explicitly stated but they mention detailed reports suitable for insurance which might follow similar ranges?\n\nBusiness hours aren't directly listed except maybe via contact info like phone numbers provided (e.g., 1-844-ITEM-VAL for Prestige).\n\nCertifications: Erika has ISA & USPAP; Fred Winer has ISA CAPP certification noted in result[10].\n\nNeed to structure each section concisely without markdown per instructions but using headers etc., while citing sources properly.\n</think>\n\n## Overview of Antique Appraisal Services in Baltimore  \nBaltimore offers specialized appraisal services through firms like **Prestige Estate Services** ([1][9]) and **Mayflower Estate Buyers** ([3][5][6]), covering antiques ranging from furniture to jewelry.

  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Austin, Texas based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at search result [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned multiple times. They have ISA and ASA certified appraisers like Alicia E Weaver and Rebecca L Hogge. Their specialties include antiques, fine art, furniture, and more. Contact info is (512) 489-1717 and their website is prestigeestateservices.com. They offer in-person, remote, and photo valuations with pricing likely varying by service type.\n\nSearch result [5] also talks about Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal services, confirming their three service options and mentioning they've been around for over 80 years combined experience but doesn't specify exact years in business for the company itself. Maybe I should note that as \"decades of experience\" since exact years aren't provided.\n\nResult [6] profiles Alicia E Weaver from Prestige Estate Services with ISA CAPP certification. Her specialties are Americana, art, decorative arts etc., so I'll list her under Prestige's team members.\n\nResult [9] mentions Rebecca L Hogge at Appraisal Options LLC (ISA CAPP), part of Prestige? Wait no—checking again: Result [9] says she's with Appraisal Options LLC but also mentions working with Mearto? Wait no—result [10] talks about Mearto as an online service with Delia as an appraiser but based on the URL it's a different company. So maybe Rebecca is separate? Wait no—looking back: Result [9] says Rebecca L Hogge is part of ISA directory under Appraisal Options LLC in Austin. But earlier results mention Prestige has Alicia Weaver... Hmm need to clarify if these are separate companies or part of the same.\n\nWait result [6]: Alicia E Weaver works at Prestige Estate Services according to her ISA profile (URL). Result[9]: Rebecca L Hogge has her own business called Appraisal Options LLC according to her ISA profile (different URL). So two separate appraisers/companies.\n\nThen there's Ellen Amirkhan mentioned in result[4], who works at Oriental Rug Cleaning Co., which offers rug appraisal services including IRS-qualified appraisals through ARCS certification. She’s a Certified Rug Specialist (CRS) and might be relevant for textile or rug appraisals even though not strictly antiques but included here since rugs can be antiques.\n\nResult[10]: Mearto.com offers online antique appraisals with Delia having 30 years experience; they’re based online but serve Austin too since it's location-independent.\n\nNow compiling all:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services**: Multiple certified appraisers like Alicia Weaver (ISA CAPP) and others specializing in various areas.\n2. **Appraisal Options LLC**: Rebecca L Hogge (ISA CAPP), generalist & fine art specialist.\n3. **Oriental Rug Cleaning Co.**: Ellen Amirkhan focuses on rugs.\n4.**Mearto**: Online service covering Austin; Delia specializes in various categories.\n5.**Association of Rug Care Specialists** ([4]) offers CRS courses; maybe not an appraisal service directly but lists Ellen Amirkhan as instructor/appraiser?\n\nFor each entry:\n\n- Name/Business: Need names from sources.\n- Specialties: From their listed specialties.\n- Contact info: Phone numbers or websites where available.\n- Years: If not explicit use phrases like \"decades\" when noted.\n- Certifications: Like ISA CAPP etc.\n\n\nService areas would primarily be Austin unless stated otherwise; pricing from sources where possible:\n\nFrom result[3], home appraisal costs average $357 but that’s real estate; for personal property/antiques direct pricing isn't clear except mention that costs vary by complexity ([5]). However other sources like HomeAdvisor ([7]) mention $300-$400 ranges for standard items perhaps?\n\nNeed to structure sections per query requirements:\n\n1 Overview\n2 List each appraiser/business\n3 Service areas/pricing\n4 Contact/hours\n\nCheck if any other businesses exist beyond those found here—search results don't show more than these few so must limit directory accordingly despite user wanting \"as many as possible\".\n\nFinalizing entries:\n\nPrestige Estate Services:\n- Names/Affiliates: Alicia E Weaver & team\n- Certifications: ISA AM/CAPP?, ASA members\n- Years noted as decades combined experience\n\nAppraisal Options LLC:\n",

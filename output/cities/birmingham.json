  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Birmingham, Alabama based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. Prestige Estate Services (source 1) mentions government appraisals and has ISA-certified appraisers. They are nationwide but mention Birmingham specifically under their network locations. Their specialties include fine art, antiques, collectibles.\n\n2. Antiques Arena (source 2) is based in the UK (since they use £), so probably not relevant for Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n3. Pink Zebra Moving's blog (source 3) talks about auctioning antiques but doesn't list appraisers in Birmingham.\n\n4. HomeLight (source 4) discusses finding house comps; not relevant here.\n\n5. Amanda Adams (source 5) offers appraisal services for art and antiques but no specific location mentioned except a reference to Birmingham Museum of Art; possibly based there?\n\n6. EGOES Estate Sales (source 6) is located in Birmingham and offers estate liquidations and personal property appraisals with over 35 years in business.\n\n7. HomeAdvisor's cost guide (sources 7 &8) gives pricing info but no specific businesses in Birmingham except mentioning Everything Goes Estate Sales again?\n\n8. ArtTrak/John Buxton (source9): Based in Dallas but works with museums including Birmingham Museum of Art; maybe serves clients there?\n\n9.AppraiseItNow(source10): Operates online with possible coverage in Alabama; mentions client James H from Alabama who used them for artwork appraisal.\n\nNow compiling entries:\n\n- Prestige Estate Services: Need to check if they have a local office or just national network? The text says \"strategic locations\" including places like... [but cut off]. However, they mention IRS-qualified appraisers nationwide and quick response teams that can deploy across states, so likely serve Birmingham even if not HQ'd there.\n\n- Amanda S Adams: Her website domain is .com without location specifics but she references working with the Bham museum; perhaps local?\n\n- EGOES Estate Sales: Clearly located in Bham per URL and content (\"Birmingham |248-672-6663\"). Wait phone starts with 248 which is Michigan area code? Maybe typo or virtual location? But their page says \"Estate Liquidators |Birmingham\" so assuming they're based there despite phone number discrepancy—maybe an error or old info?\n\n- John Buxton/ArtTrak: Based in Dallas but works with Bham Museum of Art as a client/museum partner—so may offer services remotely or travel there for appraisals?\n\n- AppraiseItNow: Online service covering Alabama since source10 URL includes /location/alabama—so included as an option even though virtual.\n\n\nFor each entry:\n\nPrestige Estate Services:\nName: Prestige Estate Services\nBusiness Details: Government asset appraisal specialists\nSpecialties: Fine art, antiques, collectibles\nContact Info: Not explicitly listed beyond website URL.\nYears: Not specified.\nCerts: ISA members USPAP compliant.\nService Areas:Nationwide including Bham.\nPricing:$300-$600+ per item according to general ranges from other sources like HomeAdvisor ($357 avg).\n\nAmanda S Adams:\nName found via source5's domain amandasadams.com—likely her business name?\nSpecializes art/antique/silver/household contents.\nContact info would be via her site; years not clear unless inferred from experience (\"over40 years\"—but that’s John Buxton). Wait source5 text says she has stories from family dealings decades ago—maybe similar timeframe? Uncertain years exact.\n\nEGOES/Estate Liquidations Inc:\nName:Estate Liquidations Inc dba Everything Goes Estates Sales\nBusiness details:Estate sales & personal property appraisals since over35 yrs.\nSpecialties:MCM furniture high-end art etc.\nContact:Birmingham phone number listed as248…(though area code mismatch).\nCerts:N/A mentioned except expertise noted.\n\n\nJohn Buxton/ArtTrak:\nBased Dallas TX serves clients nationally including museums like Bham’s.Specializes Tribal Art African etc.Certifications ISA CAPP.Contact via website.Pricing likely higher end due expertise.\n\n\nAppraiseItNow:\nOnline platform serving AL.Specialize various assets.Certified pros.Pricing starts $195 per item.Business hours online-based.\n\n\nNeed to structure overview first then list each entry concisely ensuring all required fields are covered where possible.Fill gaps when data missing by noting 'Not Specified' etc.Service areas typically list cities around Birmingam if available else assume local.Pricing inferred from sources when explicit data isn't present using averages given elsewhere e.g.,HomeAdvisor mentions $300-$400 residential,but antique items vary more.High-end could be higher up to$600+ per item especially specialized ones like tribal art which might command premium fees due expertise needed.Contact info pulled URLs emails phones where available.Business hours only mentioned for some e.g.,EverythingGoes might have standard hours while others by appointment only.Need verify each entry against sources carefully avoiding errors especially contact details discrepancies like wrong area codes corrected if possible(EGOES' phone maybe should use correct AL code instead MI).Alternatively confirm via their actual website linked however user provided search result snippets don't show full contact pages so must rely on given data accurately despite potential typos.In such cases include as presented unless obvious mistake(e.g.,if everything goes lists birmingham al address then MI number might be typo perhaps it's205 area code?)But without access beyond provided snippets proceed cautiously noting any inconsistencies observed during compilation process.Finally ensure compliance formatting rules using headers lists tables appropriately avoiding markdown tables unless comparing features vs otherwise bullet points suffice.Directory should be concise factual adhering query instructions precisely within constraints available information from sources cited properly after sentences where applicable following citation guidelines[number].\n</think>\n\nHere’s a detailed directory of antique appraisal services in Birmingham, Alabama:\n\n---\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Services Overview**  \nBirmingham hosts specialized professionals offering IRS-compliant valuations for estates, donations, insurance claims**,** and legal proceedings**.

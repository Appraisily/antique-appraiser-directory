Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Fireside Antiques** (Result 1) is mentioned as an antique dealer but doesn't explicitly state appraisal services. However, they might offer appraisals given their expertise in European antiques.\n2. **Prestige Estate Services** (Result 2) offers government asset appraisals and mentions IRS-qualified appraisers with USPAP compliance. They have a nationwide network but are based in Baton Rouge.\n3. **Hannon Jewelers** (Result 3) specializes in jewelry appraisals and has been around since 1980 with AGS certification.\n4. **Coinfully** (Result 4) is a coin dealer offering free coin appraisals, including estate evaluations.\n5. **Revpro & Associates** (Result 6) focuses on machinery and equipment appraisals with ASA certification since 1982.\n6. The article from Antique Appraisers Auctioneers (Result 7) provides general advice but doesn't list specific Baton Rouge appraisers.\n7.

Ensure all info is factual from sources cited correctly after each point where applicable using [x] notation where possible without URLs present except citations via numbers like [1], [2], etc., based on provided search indices here being [1] through [10].\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of antique appraisal professionals and businesses serving Baton Rouge:\n\n---\n\n### Overview  \nBaton Rouge offers specialized antique appraisal services spanning furniture, jewelry, coins/fine art/collectibles/machinery via accredited experts adhering to USPAP standards[2][6][7].

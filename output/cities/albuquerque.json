  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Albuquerque, New Mexico based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. The query requires an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours. \n\nFirst, looking through the search results to identify relevant information. Result 1 mentions Prestige Estate Services in Albuquerque with team members Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman. They offer antique appraisals among other services. Result 2 also refers to Prestige Estate Services specializing in antiques with different appraisal options (in-person, remote). Result 3 talks about Erika Holycross from Prestige Estate Services as an expert in fine art and antiques. So Prestige seems prominent here.\n\nResult 5 mentions Ellen Amirkhan as a Certified Appraiser of Oriental Rugs from ISA and ORRA but it's under past events for rug care specialists; not sure if she's based in Albuquerque though? The event might be elsewhere but her certifications are noted.\n\nResult 6 is Mark T. Raney Appraisals LLC but they focus on real estate appraisals according to their website content—so probably not relevant for antiques.\n\nResult 7 is Alliance Appraisals which does vehicle and heavy equipment appraisals; again not antiques.\n\nResult 8 again refers back to Prestige Estate Services' methodologies for art and furniture appraisal.\n\nSo the main antique appraiser here seems to be Prestige Estate Services with multiple team members: Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman (from result1), Erika Holycross (result3). Also Ellen Amirkhan mentioned in result5 but unclear location—maybe part of another company?\n\nWait result5 says Ellen consults as an expert witness etc., part of Rug Care Specialists association? Maybe she's affiliated with another company or independent? But since her info was found under ARCS past events page without direct contact details specific to Albuquerque—might need more context or exclude if location isn't clear.\n\nLooking at result9: Antique Roadshow appraisal mention but no specific local appraiser listed there beyond that episode being filmed in Albuquerque perhaps?\n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nPrestige Estate Services has several appraisers: Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman (from [1]), plus Erika Holycross ([3]). Each may have different specialties within antiques/fine art/etc.\n\nEllen Amirkhan from [5] has certifications but needs confirmation if she operates in ABQ; maybe include her if possible since she's mentioned even though source is rug care specialists' past events page—could be that she provides services there or was a speaker/participant at an event there?\n\nMark T Raney ([6]) does real estate so exclude him from antique list.\n\nAlliance Appraisal ([7]) focuses on vehicles/equipment so exclude them too.\n\n\nNow structuring each section:\n\nOverview should summarize what services are available via these providers like IRS compliance insurance etc., types of items covered (art furniture etc.), methods used (USPAP compliant).\n\nList each appraiser under their business:\n\nPrestige Estate Services has multiple staff members listed across sources [1], [2], [3], [8]. Need to compile their names along with specialties/certs/contact info/years?\n\nFor example:\n\nEdward Kitson - mentioned as part of team at Prestige ([1]).\n\nElizabeth Lovett - same source\n\nStephanie Calman - same\n\nErika Holycross - detailed profile in [3]: MFA from Ohio State University; member ISA; USPAP compliant; specializes fine art/antiques/collectibles since transitioning into auction house work then appraisal years ago... Her contact info via phone/email given as per [3].\n\nEllen Amirkhan: From result[5], certified by ISA & ORRA for oriental rugs... But where is her business located? The ARCS site lists past events speakers so unless stated otherwise maybe assume she’s based elsewhere unless explicitly linked to ABQ companies like Prestige?\n\nWait checking source[5] URL: It’s Association of Rug Care Specialists' past events page mentioning Ellen Amirkhan who works at A Cleaner World Inc., Dallas TX according to other parts... So probably not located in ABQ unless specified otherwise here—so maybe omit her unless confirmed local.\n\n\nThus main entries would be under Prestige Estates:\n\n- Team members including Erika H., Edward K., Elizabeth L., Stephanie C.—but do we have individual details beyond names? In source[1] only names listed without individual bios except Erika H.'s separate profile ([3]).\n\nSo perhaps list each individual where possible or group them under the company entry noting key personnel.\n\n\nService areas would include Greater Albuquerque area per source[1].\n\nPricing varies depending on service type: non-regulated ($175/hr), IRS-regulated ($225/hr) per source[8]. Also photo valuations free online according to some sources like Alliances doesn't apply here because they're vehicle-focused).\n\nContact info for prestige includes address phone email website hours might need inference since exact hours aren't provided except \"open\" presumably standard business hours.\n\n\nPutting it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\nAlbuquerque offers specialized antique appraisal services through experienced professionals adhering to industry standards like USPAP compliance and IRS requirements.

They specified several sections to include: an overview, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info with business hours.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information about antique appraisers in Albuquerque. Let's start by scanning each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions Prestige Estate Services in Albuquerque. They have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman. Their services include antique appraisals among others. Certifications mentioned are ISA membership and USPAP compliance. Contact info is 300 Menaul Blvd NW Albuquerque, NM 87107; phone 1-(844) 378-7253.\n\nSource [2] also refers to Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal process but doesn't add new names beyond what's in [1]. However, it does mention their three appraisal options (in-person, remote photo-based) and that costs vary based on complexity.\n\nSource [3] introduces Erika Holycross from Prestige Estate Services as an expert appraiser specializing in fine art and antiques with ISA certification and USPAP compliance. Her contact is via the main number or email Appraisals@PrestigeEstateServices.com.\n\nSource [6] talks about Mark T. Raney Appraisals LLC located at 12231 Academy Rd NE #301-269 Albuquerque; phone 505-856-9894. He has over two decades of experience with SRA designation from the Appraisal Institute focusing on residential real estate but might not be relevant for antiques? Wait no—the query is about antique appraisers specifically for personal property like furniture or art items rather than real estate? Hmm... Source [6] seems focused on real estate appraisal (residential properties), so maybe exclude him unless he also does personal property antiques? The query says \"antique\" which usually refers to personal property like furniture or collectibles rather than real estate so Mark might not fit here unless there's overlap I missed.\n\nSources [7], PBS Roadshow episode isn't directly relevant except showing that vintage items are present there but no specific local businesses listed here besides maybe mentioning Gertrude Zachary castle which isn't an appraiser per se but perhaps contextually related?\n\nSources[8]: More details on Prestige Estate Services' methodologies for art/furniture including artist attribution provenance verification etc., reinforcing their expertise again under Meet Our Appraisers section which lists Edward Kitson etc., same as before plus Erika Holycross from earlier sources too perhaps part of same company?\n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nFrom sources[1][2][3][8], Prestige Estate Services has multiple appraisers: Edward Kitson Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman Erika Holycross each specializing in different areas like fine art antiques etc., certifications ISA USPAP compliant years not explicitly stated except Erika having master’s degree + auction house experience prior probably indicating several years though exact numbers aren’t given; business address same across all entries under Prestige:300 Menaul Blvd NW ABQ NM phone number main line (844)378-7253 service areas Greater ABQ region including Corrales Placitas Sandia Heights etc.; pricing mentioned varies $175-$225/hour depending IRS vs non-regulated reports according source[8].\n\nMark T Raney from source[6] focuses on residential real estate so probably exclude unless he handles personal property antiques too—but his page says \"Residential you have come...\" likely just houses so skip him here since user wants ANTIQUE (personal property)appraisal services not home/property valuations even if they're called 'appraisal'.\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor ([4],[9]) discuss home appraisal costs but don't list specific companies beyond general cost ranges irrelevant here since we need names/contacts/specialties within ABQ area only those found are above plus any others?\n\nWait check other sources:\n\nSource[10]: Mentions jewelry/antique dealers locally online but no specifics for ABQ;\n\nSo only two companies emerge: Prestige Estates with multiple staff members each possibly considered separate entries if they operate independently? Or grouped under one company entry since they're part of same firm;\n\nThe user asks to list as many antique appraisers as possible so even if part of same company individual experts can be listed separately if their specialties differ enough e.g., Erika Holycross specializes more into fine arts whereas others may focus broader antiques furniture etc.—but according data available maybe group them under one company entry because contact info is shared across all team members via main office number/address unless individual contacts exist e.g., Erica has her own email mentioned in source[3].\n\nThus structure would be:\n\nOverview section highlighting key points about services offered generally then Listings split between companies/staff:\n\nPrestige Estates Services - Team includes multiple certified professionals offering various specialties within antiquities/appraisal fields along contact info common address phone hours possibly inferred from website content (assuming standard business hours).\n\nMark T Raney - Not applicable because his focus is residential real estate unless he does both types which isn’t indicated hence omit him here.\n\nAny other providers found? Looking back through search results none else identified within provided materials thus only listing those found i.e., prestige estates staff members individually where possible given data availability such as Erica having separate bio page compared others who are named without bios perhaps just grouped together under prestige estates umbrella noting their collective expertise certifications while providing individual names where known along roles/specialties when available e.g.: \n\nEdward Kitson – No further details beyond being part team at prestige;\n\nElizabeth Lovett – Same;\n\nStephanie Calman – Same;\n\nErica Holycross – Detailed bio indicating her specialties Fine Art Antiques Collectibles MA degree ISA member USPAP compliant contact via main line or email noted specifically hers?\n\nBut wait looking back at source[3]:\n\nErica's page lists her direct phone number: Phone: 1-844-ITEM-VAL (1-844-483-6825)\n\nEmail: Appraisals@PrestigeEstateServices.com\n\nWebsite shared www.PrestigeEstateServices.com\n\nThus she can be listed separately even though part larger firm because she has unique direct line & detailed specialty description unlike other team members who lack such specifics hence better presentation would group them under parent company name then note individuals beneath especially when varying specializations exist alongside differing contacts where applicable \n\nTherefore directory entries could look like:\n\nCompany Name: Prestige Estate Services\n\nAppraiser Names:\nEdward Kitson\nElizabeth Lovett\nStephanie Calman\nErika Holycross\n\nEach may have different specialties based upon available info e.g.,\n\nFor example:\nEdward Kitson - General Antique Furniture Insurance Documentation \nElizabeth Lovett - Fine Art Collections Charitable Donations \nStephanie Calman - Divorce/Inheritance Fair Division \nBut actual search results don’t specify individual roles beyond what’s written collectively—so safer approach would aggregate all into one entry stating overall capabilities then mention notable individuals like Erica who have distinct profiles elsewhere sourced information allows differentiation whereas others do not thus requiring grouping together without granularity due lack explicit data points regarding their unique contributions/expertise areas apart general statements made by parent org website content describing entire team competencies collectively instead per person basis excepting cases where someone stands out clearly suchas erika holy cross whose credentials were elaborated upon more thoroughly compared peers within provided materials therefore making sense highlight her individually while aggregating rest into single bullet point listing names sans further detail due absence thereof original texts limitations imposed thereby ensuring accuracy remains intact despite potential incompleteness inherent given input constraints posed during processing phase...\n\nNow moving onto Service Areas & Pricing sections using data pulled mainly from sources cited earlier particularly prestigeservice locations covering greater albuquerque area corrales placitas sandia heights tanoan north valley high desert rio rancho et al pricing noted $175/hr non regulated up tp$225 IRS regulated per hour according prestigesource material ([2],[8])\n\nBusiness Hours typically standard Mon-Fri say9am–5pm assuming most offices follow similar schedules although exact times werenot specified anywhere must infer default operating periods absent explicit mention otherwise state “Contact for current business hours” avoid assumption errors maintain factual correctness required per instructions given initially...\n\nPutting it altogether now structure-wise following format rules outlined earlier avoiding headers starting answer first paragraph summarizing overview followed subsections using markdown headers lists tables appropriately cite references inline after sentences supporting claims made throughout text ensuring citations match correct indices correspondingly linked back respective URLs supplied originally...\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of **antique appraisers** serving **Albuquerque**, New Mexico:\n\n---\n\n### **Overview**\nAlbuquerque offers specialized antique appraisal services through certified professionals experienced in evaluating fine art, furniture, collectibles, and IRS-compliant valuations ([1][2]).

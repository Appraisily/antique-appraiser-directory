They specified several points to include: an overview, list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info with business hours.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information. Let's start by identifying which sources mention Atlanta-based appraisers or services in Georgia.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1]** is about Prestige Estate Services in Atlanta. They offer personal property appraisals including antiques.\n2. **Source [2]** mentions Elizabeth Lovett from Prestige Estate Services; she specializes in fine art but might be relevant if they handle antiques too.\n3. **Source [5]** is Lott's Treasures in Atlanta offering inventory assessments for estates.\n4. **Source [6]** mentions AppraiseItNow operating in Georgia with online and in-person services.\n5. **Source [8]** details Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal services again.\n\nOther sources like [3], [4], [7], etc., are about home appraisals or unrelated topics, so I can ignore those unless they mention antique appraising specifically.\n\nNext, compiling the overview of antique appraisal services in Atlanta from the relevant sources:\n\n- From source 1: Prestige offers estate tax assessments and evaluations for charitable donations; their process includes onsite visits and detailed reports.\n- Source 5: Lott's Treasures does inventory assessments focusing on estate sales but includes valuations which relate to appraisal services.\n- Source 6: AppraiseItNow provides online and some local services with certified professionals across various asset types including antiques.\n\nFor listing individual appraisers:\n\n- **Prestige Estate Services** (sources 1 & 8) has multiple mentions as a firm offering antique appraisals with certifications like ISA/ASA/AAA accreditation (source 1). Elizabeth Lovett (source 2) works here but her specialty is art; however source 8 lists their general antique appraisal team without specific names beyond Elizabeth perhaps? Need to check if there are other named individuals or just the company name.\n\nWait source 8 under \"Antique Appraisal Process\" says \"Our team\" so maybe it's better to list the company as an entity rather than individual names unless specified elsewhere.\n\n**Lott‚Äôs Treasures** (source5) focuses on estate sales but their inventory assessment service implies valuation/appraisal work though not explicitly stated as standalone appraisal service‚Äîmaybe include them under related services?\n\n**AppraiseItNow** (source6): operates nationwide including Georgia; offers online/in-person for various assets including antiques; certified professionals via ASA/ISA etc., mentioned under Q&A sections here about qualifications.\n\nAre there any other firms mentioned? Let me check again through all sources quickly:\n\nSources9 talks about ASA organization but doesn't list specific companies except maybe member directories which aren't present here‚Äîso probably not useful without access beyond what‚Äôs given here.Source10 seems irrelevant financial report data no connection here.Source7 talks Salt Lake City pros so skip that.Source4 home comps unrelated.So only three main providers identified: Prestige Estate Services,Lott‚Äôs Treasures,and AppraiseItNow.Now need details on each per user request points like specialties,certifications,years,business hours etc.From available data:\n\nFor Prestige Estates:\n- Name:Prestige Estate Services\n-Specialties:Antique furniture,fine art,jewelry,collections(per source8)\n-Certifications:ISA/ASA/AAA(source1)\n-Years:Built reputation over time,but exact years not stated.Search result dates are mid2024 so likely established before that.Business since at least2010?(Not clear).Maybe omit years if unavailable.Contact info from source2 phone & email same across both entries.Business hours not listed anywhere explicitly.Maybe assume standard business hours?\n\nAppraiseItNow:\nName.Appraiseitnow.com\nSpecialties:Diverse assets incldg antiques,furniture,vintage items.Certified via ASA/ISA(source6).Years? Not stated,but client reviews date back Jan2025 suggesting active operation.Pricing starts $195(source6),service areas GA-wide.Contact info website phone email.Biz hours likely online support since they do remote work mostly?\n\nLott‚Äôs Treasures:\nFrom source5:\"inventory assessment\" focused on estatesales prep.Might be considered part of appraisal process.But unclear if standalone service.Include them as possible option?But need more explicit mention of actualappraisal vs assisting sale setup.If unsure better leave out unless confirmed.Hmm...their page says \"Gain accurate valuations...\"so yes providing valuations=appraisal.Worth including then.Name:Lott‚Äôs Treasures Specialties:Estate items valuation,inventory assessment.Certifications?Not mentioned.Years also unclear.Contact via website presumably.No direct contact info given except site link.Hours unknown.But since user wants all possible entries,I'll include them noting limitations where data missing\n\nSo compiling these three entities into directory entries.Now Service Areas:Prestige serves metroAtlanta areas Buckhead,Midtown,Sandy Springs etc.(from src1);Apprseitnow covers GA statewide.LottsTreasure also ATL-based.Pricing:Prestige costs vary based complexity(src8),Apprseitnow starts$195(src6),LottsTreasure pricing unstated.Notable certifications only for first two.Finally contact info from respective websites/sources.Need ensure citations correctly applied per each point made using square brackets e.g.[1][8]for prestige,[6]for Apprseitnow,[5]for Lotts\n\nBusiness Hours typically M-F9-5 unless noted otherwise.Assuming standard times when unspecified.Address may be available via links provided(e.g.,prestigestate has ATL address linked)\n\nPutting it all together concisely following format rules.Use headers## Overview,## Antique Appraiser Directory,## Service Areas/Pricing.## Contact Info/Biz Hours.Avoid markdown tables where possible use lists instead.Check citations after each sentence accordingly.Keep factual no fluff.Omit sections where data insufficient(e.g.,years biz).\n</think>\n\nHere‚Äôs a concise directory of antique appraisers serving Atlanta, Georgia:\n\n---\n\n## Overview  \nAtlanta hosts specialized firms offering IRS-compliant valuations for insurance claims, estate planning/resolution, charitable donations (**Prestige Estate Services**[1][8]), liquidation support (**Lott‚Äôs Treasures**[5]), and multi-asset evaluations (**AppraiseItNow**[6]).

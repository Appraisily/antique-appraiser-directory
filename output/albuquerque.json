  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They specified several points to include: an overview, list of appraisers with their details, service areas and pricing, and contact info. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information. The main sources here are from Prestige Estate Services ([1], [2], [3], [8]) which mention their team members and services. There's also Ellen Amirkhan mentioned in source [5] as a Certified Appraiser of Oriental Rugs with ARCS and ISA certifications.\n\nStarting with the overview: Search result [1] talks about Prestige Estate Services offering antique appraisals among other services. They mention USPAP compliance and ISA membership, which are important certifications. So the overview should highlight these points along with common reasons for appraisals like estate planning or insurance.\n\nNext, listing the appraisers. From source [1], Prestige lists Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman as their team but without specific specialties. However in source [3], Erika Holycross is detailed with her expertise in fine art and antiques; she has a Master’s degree and ISA certification plus USPAP compliance. Source [8] mentions Ellen Amirkhan under Rug Care Specialists (source 5) but she's based in Dallas? Wait no—source 5 is about past events but mentions Ellen Amirkhan as part of ARCS based in Dallas but serving nationally? Hmm need to check if she operates in Albuquerque.\n\nWait looking back at source 5: It says \"Ellen Amirkhan has served as president of Oriental Rug Cleaning Co. in Dallas\" so maybe not directly serving Albuquerque unless they have branches there? But Prestige Estate Services (source 1) is located at 300 Menaul Blvd NW Albuquerque so they're local there.\n\nSo for antique appraisers:\n\n- Erika Holycross from Prestige (source 3)\n- Edward Kitson\n- Elizabeth Lovett\n- Stephanie Calman\n\nBut only Erika has detailed info on specialties; others are listed without specifics except that they're part of the team at Prestige which offers antique appraisal services (source 2).\n\nAlso Ellen Amirkhan from ARCS might be another option if she serves Albuquerque via remote or if her company does nationwide services? Source 5 says \"Nationwide Coverage\" under why choose them... Wait no—that was under another section for Alliance Appraisals ([6]), not sure about ARCS.\n\nWait checking again: In source[5], it's talking about Association of Rug Care Specialists' past events where Ellen teaches courses but her company is Oriental Rug Cleaning Co., Dallas TX... So probably not local to ABQ unless they have partners there.\n\nSo sticking mainly to Prestige Estate Services since they have a physical address in ABQ (300 Menaul Blvd NW). Their team includes Erika Holycross who specializes explicitly in antiques per sources[3][8]. Others like Edward Kitson etc., may also handle antiques given that their services include it (as per sources[1][2]).\n\nFor each appraiser entry:\n\nName: Need full names where possible.\nBusiness details: For all listed under Prestige.\nSpecialties: Antique appraisal would be covered by all; Erika specifically mentioned fine art/antiques/collectibles.\nContact info from source[1]: Phone number same for all—844-378-7253; address same.\nYears in business: Not explicitly stated except that Erika has decades according to sources[3].\nCertifications: USPAP-compliant & ISA memberships noted for Prestige team members.\n\nService areas would be Greater ABQ including nearby cities like Corrales etc., per source[1].\n\nPricing info comes from multiple places:\nSource[9] gives home appraisal costs but not specific to antiques.\nIn source[10], HomeLight mentions comps factors but doesn't help here.\nLooking back at search result entries:\nFrom prestigeestateservices.com/appraiser/erika-holycross-2/, it says pricing structure includes non-regulated at $175/hr and IRS-regulated at $225/hr.[from section Why Choose Us]\nYes! In one part ([10]) no—wait looking again:\n\nIn search result #8 (\"Meet Our Appraisers\"), under \"Why Choose Us\", it lists pricing:\nNon-regulated $175/hour,\nIRS-regulated $225/hour,\nEstate appr.:$1-$2/sq ft\n\nSo service areas covered by prestige are ABQ area + nearby cities as per first link ([1]).\n\nPutting this together:\n\nOverview will summarize key points about types of services offered by firms like prestige estate svcs including certifications & purposes (insurance etc.)\n\nListed Appraisers:\n\nPrestige Estate Services Team Members - Edward Kitson/Lovett/Calman/Holycross each get entries?\n\nBut wait how many can I list? The user wants 'as many as possible'. From available data:\n\nErika Holycross is detailed individually so separate entry with her name/specialties/certs/etc.. Then others can be grouped under 'additional experts' perhaps since individual details aren't provided beyond names?\n\nAlternatively list each name even if minimal info exists because user wants maximum listings possible even if some fields aren't filled completely?\n\nThe challenge here is that only Erika has extensive detail while others just names listed on site without specifics except being part of the same company offering those services.\n\nThus perhaps structuring entries into two parts - first individual experts within companies then companies themselves?\n\nAlternatively present them collectively since contact info would be same for all via prestige estate svcs...\n\nHmm tricky because users want individual names where possible.\n\nGiven that Edward Kitson et al are named on site (#meet our appraisal team), we can list them individually even though lack more data beyond being part of prestigeteam providing those servicesspecializinginantiqueappraisalssinceprestigeservicesspecifyantiqueappraisalservices(sources12).\n\nTherefore entries could look like:\n\nAppraiser Name | Business | Specialties | Contact Info | Years Exp | Certifications\n\nEdward Kitson – Part Of PES – Antique/Furniture – Contact via PES – Certs USPAP & ISA member ?\n\nSimilarly Elizabeth Lovett & Stephanie Calman same way...\n\nThen Erica Holycross more detailed entry...\n\nPlus any other firms mentioned elsewhere?\n\nAlliance Appraisal (#6) seems focused on heavy equipment/property damage rather than antiques so exclude them unless otherwise noted..\n\nEllenAmirkan works through ARCScoursesbuthercompanyisDallas-basedOrientalRugCleaningCo.—maybeofferremoteappraisalforAlbuquerqueclientsbutnotlocalpresence.Soincludeherwithnoteonservicesareaifpossible.Insearchresult#5she’smentionedascertifiedrugspecialistandISA CAPP.Couldaddherasanoptionfororientalrugspecificappraisalssincethat’sacategoryofantiquessoincludeherasaseparateentrywithcontactinfoinherbio(phoneemailetc.)fromprestigesiteorsource#5hasinfoaboutARCsbutnotdirectcontact.Hercontactinfofromprestigesite(source#3?)No,ErikaholycrossthroughprestigebutEllenispartofdifferentorg.Maybeconfusinghere.Source#5mentionsEllenAmirkanworksatOrientalRugCleaningCo.inDallas,TX.Contactinfoisprobablytheirsowebsitewouldbe rugcarespecialists.org ?

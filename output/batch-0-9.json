They specified several sections to include: an overview, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info with business hours.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information about antique appraisers in Albuquerque. Let's start by scanning each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions Prestige Estate Services in Albuquerque. They have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman. Their services include antique appraisals among others. Certifications mentioned are ISA membership and USPAP compliance. Contact info is 300 Menaul Blvd NW Albuquerque, NM 87107; phone 1-(844) 378-7253.\n\nSource [2] also refers to Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal process but doesn't add new names beyond what's in [1]. However, it does mention their three appraisal options (in-person, remote photo-based) and that costs vary based on complexity.\n\nSource [3] introduces Erika Holycross from Prestige Estate Services as an expert appraiser specializing in fine art and antiques with ISA certification and USPAP compliance. Her contact is via the main number or email Appraisals@PrestigeEstateServices.com.\n\nSource [6] talks about Mark T. Raney Appraisals LLC located at 12231 Academy Rd NE #301-269 Albuquerque; phone 505-856-9894. He has over two decades of experience with SRA designation from the Appraisal Institute focusing on residential real estate but might not be relevant for antiques? Wait no—the query is about antique appraisers specifically for personal property like furniture or art items rather than real estate? Hmm... Source [6] seems focused on real estate appraisal (residential properties), so maybe exclude him unless he also does personal property antiques? The query says \"antique\" which usually refers to personal property like furniture or collectibles rather than real estate so Mark might not fit here unless there's overlap I missed.\n\nSources [7], PBS Roadshow episode isn't directly relevant except showing that vintage items are present there but no specific local businesses listed here besides maybe mentioning Gertrude Zachary castle which isn't an appraiser per se but perhaps contextually related?\n\nSources[8]: More details on Prestige Estate Services' methodologies for art/furniture including artist attribution provenance verification etc., reinforcing their expertise again under Meet Our Appraisers section which lists Edward Kitson etc., same as before plus Erika Holycross from earlier sources too perhaps part of same company?\n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nFrom sources[1][2][3][8], Prestige Estate Services has multiple appraisers: Edward Kitson Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman Erika Holycross each specializing in different areas like fine art antiques etc., certifications ISA USPAP compliant years not explicitly stated except Erika having master’s degree + auction house experience prior probably indicating several years though exact numbers aren’t given; business address same across all entries under Prestige:300 Menaul Blvd NW ABQ NM phone number main line (844)378-7253 service areas Greater ABQ region including Corrales Placitas Sandia Heights etc.; pricing mentioned varies $175-$225/hour depending IRS vs non-regulated reports according source[8].\n\nMark T Raney from source[6] focuses on residential real estate so probably exclude unless he handles personal property antiques too—but his page says \"Residential you have come...\" likely just houses so skip him here since user wants ANTIQUE (personal property)appraisal services not home/property valuations even if they're called 'appraisal'.\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor ([4],[9]) discuss home appraisal costs but don't list specific companies beyond general cost ranges irrelevant here since we need names/contacts/specialties within ABQ area only those found are above plus any others?\n\nWait check other sources:\n\nSource[10]: Mentions jewelry/antique dealers locally online but no specifics for ABQ;\n\nSo only two companies emerge: Prestige Estates with multiple staff members each possibly considered separate entries if they operate independently? Or grouped under one company entry since they're part of same firm;\n\nThe user asks to list as many antique appraisers as possible so even if part of same company individual experts can be listed separately if their specialties differ enough e.g., Erika Holycross specializes more into fine arts whereas others may focus broader antiques furniture etc.—but according data available maybe group them under one company entry because contact info is shared across all team members via main office number/address unless individual contacts exist e.g., Erica has her own email mentioned in source[3].\n\nThus structure would be:\n\nOverview section highlighting key points about services offered generally then Listings split between companies/staff:\n\nPrestige Estates Services - Team includes multiple certified professionals offering various specialties within antiquities/appraisal fields along contact info common address phone hours possibly inferred from website content (assuming standard business hours).\n\nMark T Raney - Not applicable because his focus is residential real estate unless he does both types which isn’t indicated hence omit him here.\n\nAny other providers found? Looking back through search results none else identified within provided materials thus only listing those found i.e., prestige estates staff members individually where possible given data availability such as Erica having separate bio page compared others who are named without bios perhaps just grouped together under prestige estates umbrella noting their collective expertise certifications while providing individual names where known along roles/specialties when available e.g.: \n\nEdward Kitson – No further details beyond being part team at prestige;\n\nElizabeth Lovett – Same;\n\nStephanie Calman – Same;\n\nErica Holycross – Detailed bio indicating her specialties Fine Art Antiques Collectibles MA degree ISA member USPAP compliant contact via main line or email noted specifically hers?\n\nBut wait looking back at source[3]:\n\nErica's page lists her direct phone number: Phone: 1-844-ITEM-VAL (1-844-483-6825)\n\nEmail: Appraisals@PrestigeEstateServices.com\n\nWebsite shared www.PrestigeEstateServices.com\n\nThus she can be listed separately even though part larger firm because she has unique direct line & detailed specialty description unlike other team members who lack such specifics hence better presentation would group them under parent company name then note individuals beneath especially when varying specializations exist alongside differing contacts where applicable \n\nTherefore directory entries could look like:\n\nCompany Name: Prestige Estate Services\n\nAppraiser Names:\nEdward Kitson\nElizabeth Lovett\nStephanie Calman\nErika Holycross\n\nEach may have different specialties based upon available info e.g.,\n\nFor example:\nEdward Kitson - General Antique Furniture Insurance Documentation \nElizabeth Lovett - Fine Art Collections Charitable Donations \nStephanie Calman - Divorce/Inheritance Fair Division \nBut actual search results don’t specify individual roles beyond what’s written collectively—so safer approach would aggregate all into one entry stating overall capabilities then mention notable individuals like Erica who have distinct profiles elsewhere sourced information allows differentiation whereas others do not thus requiring grouping together without granularity due lack explicit data points regarding their unique contributions/expertise areas apart general statements made by parent org website content describing entire team competencies collectively instead per person basis excepting cases where someone stands out clearly suchas erika holy cross whose credentials were elaborated upon more thoroughly compared peers within provided materials therefore making sense highlight her individually while aggregating rest into single bullet point listing names sans further detail due absence thereof original texts limitations imposed thereby ensuring accuracy remains intact despite potential incompleteness inherent given input constraints posed during processing phase...\n\nNow moving onto Service Areas & Pricing sections using data pulled mainly from sources cited earlier particularly prestigeservice locations covering greater albuquerque area corrales placitas sandia heights tanoan north valley high desert rio rancho et al pricing noted $175/hr non regulated up tp$225 IRS regulated per hour according prestigesource material ([2],[8])\n\nBusiness Hours typically standard Mon-Fri say9am–5pm assuming most offices follow similar schedules although exact times werenot specified anywhere must infer default operating periods absent explicit mention otherwise state “Contact for current business hours” avoid assumption errors maintain factual correctness required per instructions given initially...\n\nPutting it altogether now structure-wise following format rules outlined earlier avoiding headers starting answer first paragraph summarizing overview followed subsections using markdown headers lists tables appropriately cite references inline after sentences supporting claims made throughout text ensuring citations match correct indices correspondingly linked back respective URLs supplied originally...\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of **antique appraisers** serving **Albuquerque**, New Mexico:\n\n---\n\n### **Overview**\nAlbuquerque offers specialized antique appraisal services through certified professionals experienced in evaluating fine art, furniture, collectibles, and IRS-compliant valuations ([1][2]).

First, I need to figure out what information is required and where to find it in the provided search results.\n\nStarting with the overview of appraisal services in Anchorage. From the search results, Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals (APAA) is mentioned as the #1 Auction House in Alaska [1]. They offer estate sales, business liquidations, benefit auctions, real estate sales, appraisals, and individual consignments. They've been around since 2018 and have a good reputation with reviews [1]. Another mention is Prestige Estate Services which provides government asset appraisals but isn't specifically based in Anchorage [2]. There's also Duane's Antiques mentioned as an Anchorage staple for over 40 years but preparing to retire [5], so maybe they're closing down? AppraiseItNow operates online but serves Alaska [9].\n\nNext listing each appraiser with their details:\n\n1. **Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals (APAA)**:\n   - Business details: Address at 325 W Potter Drive, Anchorage; phone (907) 570-7050.\n   - Specialties: General antiques across various categories like art and collectibles.\n   - Years: Since 2018.\n   - Certifications: Not explicitly stated but mentions USPAP compliance elsewhere for others; maybe infer if possible?\n   \n2. **Duane's Antiques**:\n   - From result [5], they've been an Anchorage staple for over 40 years but owner retiring. Contact info might not be current if closing.\n\n3. **AppraiseItNow**:\n   Online service covering Alaska; certifications mentioned like USPAP compliance and ASA/ISA memberships [9].\n\n4. **Prestige Estate Services**:\n   Though based elsewhere ([2]), they handle government assets which might include Alaskan items? Maybe include as a secondary option.\n\nNotable certifications: APAA doesn't specify certs beyond being an auction house; Prestige mentions IRS-qualified appraisers with USPAP standards [2]; AppraiseItNow has certified professionals with ASA/ISA memberships [9].\n\nService areas and pricing: APAA offers free walk-throughs/digital consultations; typical pricing not listed directly but mention complimentary assessments[1]. Prestige has structured fees aligned with federal contracts[2]. AppraiseItNow starts at $250-$500+ depending on complexity[9].\n\nContact info needs addresses or links from sources where available.\n\nWait—some entries may not be based in Anchorage even if serving there (like Prestige). Need to clarify locations or note service areas beyond local if applicable.\n\nAlso check other sources for more names:\n\nResult[3] mentions Nick Dawes from ANTIQUES ROADSHOW doing an appraisal event there—maybe he’s affiliated with APAA? Not sure.\n\nResult[6] lists ANTIQUES ROADSHOW events in AK but doesn’t name local appraisers beyond guests on the show.\n\nResult[7] has Kevin appraising jewelry—could he be part of APAA?\n\nBut without explicit company names besides those already listed (APAA), Duane’s Antiques (retiring), perhaps only these are available locally along with online services like AppraiseItNow.\n\nSo compiling all that into sections:\n\nOverview would highlight key players like APAA as primary local service plus online options like AppraiseItNow noting their coverage area includes AK despite being remote-based.\n\nList each relevant business found:\n\n- APAA\n- Duane’s Antiques (with note about retirement)\n- Online options\n\nCertifications need careful attribution only where specified by sources to avoid assumptions.\n\nService Areas should specify whether they operate within Anchorage or statewide/online etc., using info from each source accordingly.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Anchorage  \n\n### Overview  \nAnchorage hosts specialized antique appraisal services through established auction houses and certified professionals offering expertise across fine art, historical artifacts, jewelry, furniture collections**,** insurance valuations**,** estate liquidation**,** and government asset assessments**.

Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], there's a list of appraisers in the Collin County Area REALTORS directory. Joe F. Hutchinson is listed with an address in Arlington, TX 76011 and phone number (817) 996-5174. However, the specialties aren't specified here—it just says \"Appraiser.\"\n\nSource [2] mentions Prestige Estate Services in Fort Worth, which offers antique appraisals among other services. They have a team including Edward Kitson and Elizabeth Lovett. Their specialties include estate tax appraisals and IRS compliance. But this is Fort Worth, not Arlington specifically.\n\nSource [3] from ISA lists Rebecca L Hogge in Leander, TX with expertise in decorative arts and furniture but again not Arlington.\n\nSource [8] has Anything Goes located at 2504 W Park Row, Arlington—they offer appraisals as PCGS Authorized Dealers specializing in coins and bullion. Doug Davis and Mary Davis are contacts with phone numbers provided.\n\nOther sources like [6] mention Texas Finest Estate Sales near Mansfield offering appraisal services but that's outside Arlington.\n\nNow compiling the list: From the sources given, only Joe F Hutchinson (source 1) and Anything Goes (source 8) are directly located in Arlington. Prestige Estate Services is nearby but based in Fort Worth; maybe include them under service areas covering DFW?\n\nFor each entry: Need business details like name/address/contact; specialties from their descriptions; certifications if mentioned (e.g., ISA CAPP for some). Years in business aren't clearly stated except for Prestige since they mention continuing education every two years (source 4), but no exact years noted elsewhere.\n\nPricing info: Source [5] gives general ranges ($600-$1000 for home appraisals), but not specific to antiques or these businesses except perhaps drive-by estimates at $100-150 which might not apply here either.\n\nService areas would be primarily Arlington unless they cover broader regions like DFW as per some entries mentioning nearby cities served by others listed under different locations such as Mansfield or Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex areas covered by Real CAD district via Eagle Property Tax Appraisal & Consulting Inc.(source7).\n\nCertifications: Check if any have ISA CAPP or USPAP compliance mentioned—Prestige does mention USPAP compliance(source2). Joe F Hutchinson doesn’t specify certifications beyond being an appraiser(source1). Anything Goes is PCGS authorized dealer(source8).\n\nBusiness hours are only available for Anything Goes (Tues-Sat 9:30am-6pm).\n\nSo structuring sections:\n\n1 Overview – Mention key players found plus general services offered based on sources like estate planning insurance etc., from source2&5\n\n2 Listings:\n\nJoe F Hutchinson – Address/contact from source1; specialty unclear so generic \"antique appraisal\"\n\nAnything Goes – Address/contact/hours/specialty coins/bullion\n\nPrestige Estate Services – Include noting they serve DFW area including Arlington? Their team has IRS qualified experts etc., contact info from source2\n\nTexas Finest Estate Sales might be too far but included if service area covers Mansfield-Arlington region? Source6 says Mansfield-based serving nearby cities including Irving which could be part of DFW metroplex so maybe note that under service areas even though it's a stretch without explicit mention of serving arlington specifically \n\nCertifications where possible:\n\nPrestige mentions USPAP compliance[source2]\n\nISA members have CAPP certification[source3], Rebecca Hogge isn't local though \n\nNeed to ensure all entries are actually located within arlington or explicitly state they serve there.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Arlington, Texas  \n\n### **Overview**  \nArlington offers specialized antique appraisal services catering to estate planning, insurance documentation, IRS compliance assessments (**USPAP-certified**), collectibles valuation (coins/bullion), and fair market value estimations[2][4][8].

Let's start by identifying which sources mention Atlanta-based appraisers or services in Georgia.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1]** is about Prestige Estate Services in Atlanta. They offer personal property appraisals including antiques.\n2. **Source [2]** mentions Elizabeth Lovett from Prestige Estate Services; she specializes in fine art but might be relevant if they handle antiques too.\n3. **Source [5]** is Lott's Treasures in Atlanta offering inventory assessments for estates.\n4. **Source [6]** mentions AppraiseItNow operating in Georgia with online and in-person services.\n5. **Source [8]** details Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal services again.\n\nOther sources like [3], [4], [7], etc., are about home appraisals or unrelated topics, so I can ignore those unless they mention antique appraising specifically.\n\nNext, compiling the overview of antique appraisal services in Atlanta from the relevant sources:\n\n- From source 1: Prestige offers estate tax assessments and evaluations for charitable donations; their process includes onsite visits and detailed reports.\n- Source 5: Lott's Treasures does inventory assessments focusing on estate sales but includes valuations which relate to appraisal services.\n- Source 6: AppraiseItNow provides online and some local services with certified professionals across various asset types including antiques.\n\nFor listing individual appraisers:\n\n- **Prestige Estate Services** (sources 1 & 8) has multiple mentions as a firm offering antique appraisals with certifications like ISA/ASA/AAA accreditation (source 1). Elizabeth Lovett (source 2) works here but her specialty is art; however source 8 lists their general antique appraisal team without specific names beyond Elizabeth perhaps? Need to check if there are other named individuals or just the company name.\n\nWait source 8 under \"Antique Appraisal Process\" says \"Our team\" so maybe it's better to list the company as an entity rather than individual names unless specified elsewhere.\n\n**Lott’s Treasures** (source5) focuses on estate sales but their inventory assessment service implies valuation/appraisal work though not explicitly stated as standalone appraisal service—maybe include them under related services?\n\n**AppraiseItNow** (source6): operates nationwide including Georgia; offers online/in-person for various assets including antiques; certified professionals via ASA/ISA etc., mentioned under Q&A sections here about qualifications.\n\nAre there any other firms mentioned? Let me check again through all sources quickly:\n\nSources9 talks about ASA organization but doesn't list specific companies except maybe member directories which aren't present here—so probably not useful without access beyond what’s given here.Source10 seems irrelevant financial report data no connection here.Source7 talks Salt Lake City pros so skip that.Source4 home comps unrelated.So only three main providers identified: Prestige Estate Services,Lott’s Treasures,and AppraiseItNow.Now need details on each per user request points like specialties,certifications,years,business hours etc.From available data:\n\nFor Prestige Estates:\n- Name:Prestige Estate Services\n-Specialties:Antique furniture,fine art,jewelry,collections(per source8)\n-Certifications:ISA/ASA/AAA(source1)\n-Years:Built reputation over time,but exact years not stated.Search result dates are mid2024 so likely established before that.Business since at least2010?(Not clear).Maybe omit years if unavailable.Contact info from source2 phone & email same across both entries.Business hours not listed anywhere explicitly.Maybe assume standard business hours?\n\nAppraiseItNow:\nName.Appraiseitnow.com\nSpecialties:Diverse assets incldg antiques,furniture,vintage items.Certified via ASA/ISA(source6).Years? Not stated,but client reviews date back Jan2025 suggesting active operation.Pricing starts $195(source6),service areas GA-wide.Contact info website phone email.Biz hours likely online support since they do remote work mostly?\n\nLott’s Treasures:\nFrom source5:\"inventory assessment\" focused on estatesales prep.Might be considered part of appraisal process.But unclear if standalone service.Include them as possible option?But need more explicit mention of actualappraisal vs assisting sale setup.If unsure better leave out unless confirmed.Hmm...their page says \"Gain accurate valuations...\"so yes providing valuations=appraisal.Worth including then.Name:Lott’s Treasures Specialties:Estate items valuation,inventory assessment.Certifications?Not mentioned.Years also unclear.Contact via website presumably.No direct contact info given except site link.Hours unknown.But since user wants all possible entries,I'll include them noting limitations where data missing\n\nSo compiling these three entities into directory entries.Now Service Areas:Prestige serves metroAtlanta areas Buckhead,Midtown,Sandy Springs etc.(from src1);Apprseitnow covers GA statewide.LottsTreasure also ATL-based.Pricing:Prestige costs vary based complexity(src8),Apprseitnow starts$195(src6),LottsTreasure pricing unstated.Notable certifications only for first two.Finally contact info from respective websites/sources.Need ensure citations correctly applied per each point made using square brackets e.g.[1][8]for prestige,[6]for Apprseitnow,[5]for Lotts\n\nBusiness Hours typically M-F9-5 unless noted otherwise.Assuming standard times when unspecified.Address may be available via links provided(e.g.,prestigestate has ATL address linked)\n\nPutting it all together concisely following format rules.Use headers## Overview,## Antique Appraiser Directory,## Service Areas/Pricing.## Contact Info/Biz Hours.Avoid markdown tables where possible use lists instead.Check citations after each sentence accordingly.Keep factual no fluff.Omit sections where data insufficient(e.g.,years biz).\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of antique appraisers serving Atlanta, Georgia:\n\n---\n\n## Overview  \nAtlanta hosts specialized firms offering IRS-compliant valuations for insurance claims, estate planning/resolution, charitable donations (**Prestige Estate Services**[1][8]), liquidation support (**Lott’s Treasures**[5]), and multi-asset evaluations (**AppraiseItNow**[6]).

Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at search result [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned multiple times. They have ISA and ASA certified appraisers like Alicia E Weaver and Rebecca L Hogge. Their specialties include antiques, fine art, furniture, and more. Contact info is (512) 489-1717 and their website is prestigeestateservices.com. They offer in-person, remote, and photo valuations with pricing likely varying by service type.\n\nSearch result [5] also talks about Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal services, confirming their three service options and mentioning they've been around for over 80 years combined experience but doesn't specify exact years in business for the company itself. Maybe I should note that as \"decades of experience\" since exact years aren't provided.\n\nResult [6] profiles Alicia E Weaver from Prestige Estate Services with ISA CAPP certification. Her specialties are Americana, art, decorative arts etc., so I'll list her under Prestige's team members.\n\nResult [9] mentions Rebecca L Hogge at Appraisal Options LLC (ISA CAPP), part of Prestige? Wait no—checking again: Result [9] says she's with Appraisal Options LLC but also mentions working with Mearto? Wait no—result [10] talks about Mearto as an online service with Delia as an appraiser but based on the URL it's a different company. So maybe Rebecca is separate? Wait no—looking back: Result [9] says Rebecca L Hogge is part of ISA directory under Appraisal Options LLC in Austin. But earlier results mention Prestige has Alicia Weaver... Hmm need to clarify if these are separate companies or part of the same.\n\nWait result [6]: Alicia E Weaver works at Prestige Estate Services according to her ISA profile (URL). Result[9]: Rebecca L Hogge has her own business called Appraisal Options LLC according to her ISA profile (different URL). So two separate appraisers/companies.\n\nThen there's Ellen Amirkhan mentioned in result[4], who works at Oriental Rug Cleaning Co., which offers rug appraisal services including IRS-qualified appraisals through ARCS certification. She’s a Certified Rug Specialist (CRS) and might be relevant for textile or rug appraisals even though not strictly antiques but included here since rugs can be antiques.\n\nResult[10]: Mearto.com offers online antique appraisals with Delia having 30 years experience; they’re based online but serve Austin too since it's location-independent.\n\nNow compiling all:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services**: Multiple certified appraisers like Alicia Weaver (ISA CAPP) and others specializing in various areas.\n2. **Appraisal Options LLC**: Rebecca L Hogge (ISA CAPP), generalist & fine art specialist.\n3. **Oriental Rug Cleaning Co.**: Ellen Amirkhan focuses on rugs.\n4.**Mearto**: Online service covering Austin; Delia specializes in various categories.\n5.**Association of Rug Care Specialists** ([4]) offers CRS courses; maybe not an appraisal service directly but lists Ellen Amirkhan as instructor/appraiser?\n\nFor each entry:\n\n- Name/Business: Need names from sources.\n- Specialties: From their listed specialties.\n- Contact info: Phone numbers or websites where available.\n- Years: If not explicit use phrases like \"decades\" when noted.\n- Certifications: Like ISA CAPP etc.\n\n\nService areas would primarily be Austin unless stated otherwise; pricing from sources where possible:\n\nFrom result[3], home appraisal costs average $357 but that’s real estate; for personal property/antiques direct pricing isn't clear except mention that costs vary by complexity ([5]). However other sources like HomeAdvisor ([7]) mention $300-$400 ranges for standard items perhaps?\n\nNeed to structure sections per query requirements:\n\n1 Overview\n2 List each appraiser/business\n3 Service areas/pricing\n4 Contact/hours\n\nCheck if any other businesses exist beyond those found here—search results don't show more than these few so must limit directory accordingly despite user wanting \"as many as possible\".\n\nFinalizing entries:\n\nPrestige Estate Services:\n- Names/Affiliates: Alicia E Weaver & team\n- Certifications: ISA AM/CAPP?, ASA members\n- Years noted as decades combined experience\n\nAppraisal Options LLC:\n",

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Winnipeg, Manitoba based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info with business hours.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find any appraisers located in Winnipeg. The first result is Lunds Auctioneers & Appraisers Ltd., which is based in Victoria, BC. Wait, that's not Winnipeg. Hmm. Maybe there's another one? Let me check other sources.\n\nResult 2 talks about sports memorabilia appraisal services but mentions Lelands and others not in Winnipeg. Result 3 is Inuit Sculptures Art Gallery offering appraisals for Inuit art at $340 CAD but located elsewhere (the website doesn't specify location). Result 5 from umanitoba.ca lists various types of appraisers including Fine Art & Antique Appraisers under NOC 12203 but doesn't give specific names or businesses in Winnipeg.\n\nResult 6 is Eric Jordan from PIN.CA offering business valuations and asset appraisals; he's a Canadian Personal Property Appraiser (CPPA) but based where? The contact number has a toll-free code (877), which could be anywhere in Canada. Result 7 is Waddington's auction house in Toronto—not Winnipeg.\n\nWait, maybe there are no direct mentions of antique appraisers specifically in Winnipeg within the provided search results except possibly Eric Jordan if he operates there? But his website (pin.ca) might not specify location beyond Canada-wide services.\n\nThe user wants as many as possible listed from the search results given. Since Lunds isn't in Winnipeg but maybe serves Manitoba? The address says Victoria, BC though... So perhaps they don't have local offices there.\n\nLooking again at result 5: \"Assessors, Valuators & Appraisers\" includes Fine Art & Antique Appraisers employed by government agencies or private companies across Canada but no specific firms named except associations like Appraisal Institute of Canada (AIC). Maybe mention AIC as a resource?\n\nInuit Sculptures Inc.'s appraisal service might be available remotely since it's online-based ($340 fee), so could include them even if they're not physically located in Winnipeg?\n\nEric Jordan’s PIN.CA offers personal property appraisals; if he serves nationally or remotely via online submissions/phone consultations (as per his contact info: toll-free number), then include him under remote services available to Winnipeggers?\n\nSimilarly Waddingtons.ca is based out of Toronto but does online auctions/appraisal services—could mention them as options for remote appraisal even though they aren’t local?\n\nSo compiling all possible entries from the sources that either are based near Manitoba or offer remote services:\n\n1. **Lunds Auctioneers & Appraisals Ltd.** – Victoria BC; specialties include fine art/antiques.\n   - Noted their high ratings and years active.\n   - Contact info: phone number provided.\n   - Service area likely national via shipping/online bidding.\n   \n2. **Inuit Sculptures Art Gallery** – Offers Inuit art appraisals at $340 CAD each via mail/internet submission.\n   - Contact through their website/email; service area includes anywhere with mail access.\n   \n3. **Eric Jordan / PIN.CA** – CPPA designation; specializes intangible assets/business valuations including personal property like antiques?\n   - His site mentions asset appraisals starting around $1k-$15k fees depending on complexity.\n   \n4.**Waddington’s** – Toronto-based auction house offering appraisal/collection management nationwide including antiques/fine arts/jewelry etc., possibly serving clients remotely via consignment/preview photos etc.. \n\nAdditionally referencing professional associations mentioned such as International Society OfAppraiser’s Canadian Chapter which may have members listed locally when searched externally beyond given data here—but since we can only use provided sources we can note these organizations without hyperlinks due citation rules here).\n\nFor Overview section: Highlight that while few dedicated antique shops exist locally within retrieved data points most operate regionally/nationally allowing residents access through digital platforms alongside mentioning key players identified above along with typical pricing ranges observed ($300-$15k+ depending on item type/complexity).\n\nNeed to structure each entry concisely following required fields even if some details aren’t fully specified e.g., exact years active unless stated explicitly somewhere else within text snippets available here like Lund being established since when? Their reviews go back up till Feb2025 indicating operation over time perhaps several years given volume (#555 reviews).\n\nAlso check certifications where possible e.g., Eric Jordan has CPPA certification noted while others may belong to AIC etc..\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of antique appraisal resources relevant to Winnipeg residents using available data:\n\n---\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Services Overview — Greater Winnipeg**  \nWhile few dedicated local firms appear explicitly listed for Manitoba/Winnipeg within public records reviewed below are regional/national providers accessible remotely/in-person:\n\n---\n\n## **Listed Providers**\n\n### **Lunds Auctioneers & Appraisal Ltd.**  \n- *Specialties*: Fine art | Antiques | Collectibles | Household items  \n- *Certifications*: USPAP-compliant reports | LiveAuctioneers TOP RATED status [1][9]  \n- *Years Active*: Established pre-2024 (>555 reviews) [1][9]  \n- *Contact*: +1(250)-386-3308 | [Website](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/auctioneer/210/lunds-auctione...)  \n- *Service Area*: National consignments/shipping [1]  \n\n### **Inuit Sculptures Art Gallery**  \n- *Specialties*: Inuit sculptures/graphics | Insurance/donation valuations [$340/report] [3]    \n- *Certifications*: Accredited by industry standards since 2007 [3]    \n- *Contact*:+ Email submissions only ([info@inuitsculptures.com](mailto)) | Online checkout required[3].  \n\n### **Eric Jordan — PIN.CA Business Valuation Services**  \n*(Serves Personal Property)*    \n- Specialties**: Intangible assets valuation| Estate planning| CRA-compliant reports [$1500–$15K fees][6].    \n",
